						<p>In more than 5,200 communities and 20 countries, Relay For Life events comprise the signature fundraiser for the American Cancer Society. Each Relay For Life event is special to its community, but the movement's true power lies in the combined commitment of thousands of participants, volunteers, and supporters to help the American Cancer Society save lives from cancer.</p>
						<p>Many moments create the unique Relay experience.</p>
						<h2>Survivors Lap</h2>
						<p>During the Survivors Lap, all cancer survivors at the event take the first lap around the track, celebrating their victory over cancer while cheered on by the other participants who line the track. Relay For Life events also recognize and celebrate caregivers, who give time, love, and support to their friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers facing cancer.</p>
						<h2>Luminaria Ceremony</h2>
						<p>The Luminaria Ceremony takes place after dark, so we can remember people we have lost to cancer, honor people who have fought cancer in the past, and support those whose fight continues. Candles are lit inside of personalized bags and are placed around the Relay track as glowing tributes to those whoâ€™ve been affected by cancer.</p>
						<h2>Fight Back Ceremony</h2>
						<p>This emotionally powerful ceremony inspires Relay participants to take action. The Fight Back Ceremony symbolizes the emotional commitment each of us can make in the fight against cancer. The action taken represents what we are willing to do for ourselves, for our loved ones, and for our community to fight cancer year-round and to commit to saving lives.</p>

						<p>Every year, the Relay For Life movement raises more than $400 million. The American Cancer Society puts these donations to work, investing in groundbreaking research in every type of cancer and providing free information and services to cancer patients and their caregivers. We're fighting for every birthday threatened by every cancer, in your community and everyone else's.</p>
						<p>This year, Relay For Life of Washington University raised over $160,000 in the fight against cancer. In the past 12 years, Washington University has helped raise over $2 million for cancer research and support. Much of that money has funded the work of Siteman Cancer Center and other St. Louis institutions. See how your support is making a difference:</p>
						<h2>Research</h2>
						<p>For more than 65 years, the American Cancer Society has been finding answers that save lives - from changes in lifestyle to new approaches in therapies to improving cancer patients' quality of life. No single nongovernmental, not-for-profit organization in the US has invested more to find the causes and cures of cancer.</p>
						<h2>Hope Lodge</h2>
						<p>Where to stay and how to afford accommodations are immediate concerns for cancer patients who must travel away from home for the best treatment. American Cancer Society Hope Lodge facilities provide a free and comfortable place for patients and their caregivers to stay, so they can focus on getting well.</p>
